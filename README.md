## Information about meetings

Meetings are held once a week. Exact time of a meeting is determined by a poll made in Doodle in which all of us vote for the appropiate date.
During the meeting, we discuss what we had achieved in a previous week and set new goals for our project. It is also a good opportunity to solve some problems that occured during our work.
