# Project Title

Rock, paper & scissors

## Project description

### Short description

Our goal is to create a clone of the classic game of ***rock, paper, scissors***. This world-class production will change the lives of many users. 
> *Especially those who call this game "sim sam sum" 🙄.

### Main features of our game

- rock beats scissors     (🪨 > ✂️)
- scissors beats paper    (✂️ > 📝)
- paper beats rock        (📝 > 🪨)

### How will it work?

1. User chooses their option by clicking on a accurate picture or typing symbol on a keyboard: 'r' stands for "rock", 'p' for "paper" and 's' for "scissors".
1. Computer draws lots its option
1. Both are displayed on screen and compared
1. Winner gets 1 point, loser - 0 (if draw both players get 0 points)

Then all of previous steps are repeated over and over again - till user decides to give up.

Another option in our game: **game between 2 users** (using Internet):
> It's works very similarly to the previous version, but I'll write here description anyway 🤗
1. First user chooses his option
1. Other one does so
1. Options are compared, score is calculated and displayed

...till someone resigns.

## Information about meetings

Meetings are held once a week. Exact time of a meeting is determined by a poll made in Doodle in which all of us vote for the appropiate date.
During the meeting, we discuss what we had achieved in a previous week and set new goals for our project. It is also a good opportunity to solve some problems that occured during our work.
Tasks for our group are on [Trello](https://trello.com/).
